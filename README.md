Overview

This project is part of the Northcoders Full Stack Bootcamp, focusing on building a RESTful API for a news application. The API serves as the backend for a Reddit-style platform, allowing users to interact with articles, comments, topics, and users. The project emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD), efficient error handling, and adherence to RESTful principles.

    Create two .env files in the root directory:

        .env.development

        .env.test

    Each file should contain:

    PGDATABASE=nc_news
               nc_news_test

    Create databases:

    npm run setup-dbs

    Run tests:

    npm test

    Start the server:

The API provides the following endpoints:

    GET /api
        Serves up a JSON representation of all available endpoints.

    GET /api/topics
        Returns an array of all topics.

    GET /api/articles
        Returns an array of all articles.

    GET /api/articles/:article_id
        Returns a specific article by ID.

    PATCH /api/articles/:article_id
        Updates the votes of a specific article.

    GET /api/articles/:article_id/comments
        Returns all comments for a specific article.

    POST /api/articles/:article_id/comments
